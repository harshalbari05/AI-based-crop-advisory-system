# SmartCrop AI - AI Based Smart Crop Advisory System

SmartCrop AI is an intelligent agricultural advisory platform that detects crop diseases from uploaded images of plant leaves, seeds, or crops and provides prevention and treatment recommendations.

The system suggests both organic and chemical solutions and includes a multilingual chatbot designed to support rural language communication, making agricultural guidance more accessible to farmers.
